### âœ… **`abstract` Keyword in Java â€“ Explanation and Need**

The `abstract` keyword in Java is used to **define abstraction**, which is a fundamental concept in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. It is used with **classes** and **methods** to create abstract classes and abstract methods, respectively.

---

### ðŸ”¥ **1. What is Abstraction?**
Abstraction is the process of **hiding implementation details** and exposing only the **essential features** of an object. It helps reduce complexity and increases code reusability.

In Java:
- You can **achieve abstraction** using:
  - **`abstract` classes** â†’ Partial abstraction.
  - **Interfaces** â†’ 100% abstraction (since Java 8, interfaces can have default and static methods).

---

### ðŸš€ **2. `abstract` Class**
An `abstract` class in Java:
- **Cannot be instantiated** (i.e., you cannot create objects of an abstract class).
- It **may or may not contain abstract methods**.
- It can have **both abstract and concrete (non-abstract) methods**.

**Syntax:**
```java
abstract class Vehicle {               // Abstract class
    abstract void startEngine();        // Abstract method
    void stopEngine() {                 // Concrete method
        System.out.println("Engine stopped");
    }
}
```

### ðŸ’¡ **Example of Abstract Class**
```java
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void makeSound();        // Abstract method

    void sleep() {                    // Concrete method
        System.out.println("Sleeping...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void makeSound() {                // Providing implementation of abstract method
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.makeSound();              // Output: Dog barks
        dog.sleep();                  // Output: Sleeping...

        // Animal animal = new Animal();   // Compilation error: Cannot instantiate abstract class
    }
}
```
âœ… **Explanation:**
- `Animal` is an **abstract class**.
- It contains:
  - An **abstract method** `makeSound()` â†’ Must be implemented by the child class.
  - A **concrete method** `sleep()` â†’ Can be inherited and used by the child class.
- You **cannot create an instance** of the abstract class directly.

---

### ðŸš€ **3. `abstract` Methods**
An `abstract` method:
- Is declared but **does not have a body**.
- Must be **implemented by subclasses**.
- Only classes marked as `abstract` can have abstract methods.

**Syntax:**
```java
abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw();             // Abstract method
}
```

---

### ðŸ’¡ **Example of Abstract Method**
```java
abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw();              // Abstract method
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    void draw() {                      // Implementing abstract method
        System.out.println("Drawing Circle");
    }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
    void draw() {                      // Implementing abstract method
        System.out.println("Drawing Rectangle");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape shape1 = new Circle();     // Upcasting
        shape1.draw();                   // Output: Drawing Circle

        Shape shape2 = new Rectangle();  // Upcasting
        shape2.draw();                   // Output: Drawing Rectangle
    }
}
```
âœ… **Explanation:**
- `Shape` is an **abstract class** with the abstract method `draw()`.
- Both `Circle` and `Rectangle` classes **implement the abstract method**.
- The program uses **polymorphism** by referring to the child class objects using the parent class reference.

---

### ðŸŽ¯ **4. Why Use the `abstract` Keyword?**
The `abstract` keyword is used to:
1. **Achieve Abstraction**:
   - Hides unnecessary details and shows only essential information.
   - Ensures that the child class provides its own implementation of the abstract methods.

2. **Enforce Method Implementation**:
   - If you want to **enforce certain methods** to be implemented in all subclasses, define them as abstract.
   - This makes the design consistent and prevents incomplete implementations.

3. **Polymorphism Support**:
   - Abstract classes are often used for **runtime polymorphism**.
   - They allow you to define common behaviors while leaving specific details to the child classes.

4. **Code Reusability**:
   - Abstract classes allow you to define **common behavior** for related classes, reducing redundancy.
   - Concrete methods in abstract classes can be reused by subclasses.

### âœ… **5. Difference Between `abstract` Class and Interface**

| Feature            | `abstract` Class                           | Interface                             |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Methods**         | Can have both abstract and concrete methods | Only abstract methods (Java 7), can have default and static methods (Java 8+) |
| **Multiple Inheritance** | Cannot extend multiple classes            | Can implement multiple interfaces     |
| **Instantiation**    | Cannot be instantiated                     | Cannot be instantiated                |
| **Access Modifiers** | Can have any access modifier               | Only `public` or `default` methods   |
| **Use case**         | When you want to share code among subclasses | When you want to define a contract   |

---

### ðŸ”¥ **6. When to Use `abstract` Classes?**
- When you want to **share common behavior** among related classes but still allow child classes to have their own implementation.
- When you want to **enforce the implementation of specific methods** in subclasses.
- When you want to create **partially abstract classes** (i.e., containing both abstract and concrete methods).

---

### âœ… **Key Takeaways**
1. The `abstract` keyword:
   - Defines **abstract classes** and **abstract methods**.
2. **Abstract class**:
   - Cannot be instantiated directly.
   - Can have both abstract and concrete methods.
3. **Abstract method**:
   - Declared without a body.
   - Must be implemented in the child class.
4. **Purpose of `abstract`:**
   - Achieves **abstraction** in OOP.
   - Enforces method implementation in child classes.
   - Improves **code reuse** and consistency.

ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip:** In modern Java development, **interfaces** are often preferred for abstraction due to their flexibility and support for multiple inheritance, but abstract classes are still useful for defining common behavior.
