### âœ… **Upcasting and Downcasting in Java**

In Java, **upcasting** and **downcasting** are used to convert objects between parent and child classes in the inheritance hierarchy.

---

### ðŸ”¥ **1. Upcasting**
Upcasting is the process of **converting a child class object to a parent class reference**. It is an implicit (automatic) conversion, and no explicit cast is required. 

**Syntax:**
```java
Parent obj = new Child();
```
- The reference variable `obj` is of the `Parent` class, but it points to an instance of the `Child` class.
- This is safe because the child class is guaranteed to have all the properties of the parent.

---

### ðŸ’¡ **Example of Upcasting**
```java
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }

    void wagTail() {
        System.out.println("Dog wags its tail");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal animal = new Dog();    // Upcasting
        animal.makeSound();           // Output: Dog barks

        // animal.wagTail();          // Compilation error: Cannot access child-specific method
    }
}
```

ðŸ“Œ **Explanation:**
- `Animal animal = new Dog();` â†’ Upcasting occurs here.
- The reference variable `animal` belongs to the `Animal` class but refers to a `Dog` object.
- Only methods defined in the **parent class** (like `makeSound`) are accessible.
- **Child-specific methods** like `wagTail()` are not accessible through the parent reference.

---

### ðŸš€ **2. Downcasting**
Downcasting is the process of **converting a parent class reference back to a child class reference**. This is an explicit conversion, so you need to use **casting** syntax.

**Syntax:**
```java
Child obj = (Child) parentReference;
```
- This is only safe if the object being referenced is actually an instance of the child class.
- Otherwise, it will throw a **`ClassCastException`** at runtime.

---

### ðŸ’¡ **Example of Downcasting**
```java
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }

    void wagTail() {
        System.out.println("Dog wags its tail");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal animal = new Dog();         // Upcasting
        Dog dog = (Dog) animal;            // Downcasting

        dog.makeSound();                   // Output: Dog barks
        dog.wagTail();                     // Output: Dog wags its tail

        // Invalid Downcasting
        Animal animal2 = new Animal();
        Dog dog2 = (Dog) animal2;          // Runtime error: ClassCastException
    }
}
```

ðŸ“Œ **Explanation:**
- `Animal animal = new Dog();` â†’ Upcasting.
- `Dog dog = (Dog) animal;` â†’ **Valid downcasting**, as the `animal` object actually refers to a `Dog` instance.
- `dog.wagTail()` â†’ Accesses child-specific method.
- `Animal animal2 = new Animal();` â†’ Trying to downcast a parent object to a child reference causes a **`ClassCastException`**.

### ðŸŽ¯ **Key Differences Between Upcasting and Downcasting**

| Feature           | Upcasting                          | Downcasting                          |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Direction**      | Child â†’ Parent                     | Parent â†’ Child                       |
| **Syntax**          | `Parent obj = new Child();`        | `Child obj = (Child) parentRef;`     |
| **Explicit/Implicit** | Implicit                         | Explicit                             |
| **Access**          | Only parent class methods         | Child-specific methods are accessible |
| **Runtime error**    | No runtime error                 | May throw `ClassCastException`       |
| **Use case**         | Polymorphism                     | To access child-specific methods     |

### âœ… **When to Use Upcasting and Downcasting?**
- **Upcasting**
  - Used when you want to treat a child object as a parent object.
  - Helps in **polymorphism**.
- **Downcasting**
  - Used when you want to access child-specific properties or methods.
  - Only safe when you are sure the reference refers to a child class object.

### ðŸš€ **Real-World Example: Upcasting & Downcasting in Polymorphism**
```java
class Employee {
    void work() {
        System.out.println("Employee works");
    }
}

class Developer extends Employee {
    void work() {
        System.out.println("Developer writes code");
    }

    void debug() {
        System.out.println("Developer debugs the code");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee emp = new Developer();   // Upcasting
        emp.work();                       // Output: Developer writes code

        // Downcasting to access child-specific method
        if (emp instanceof Developer) {
            Developer dev = (Developer) emp;
            dev.debug();                  // Output: Developer debugs the code
        }
    }
}
```
âœ… In this example:
- **Upcasting** allows treating `Developer` as an `Employee` for polymorphism.
- **Downcasting** safely accesses the `Developer`-specific method (`debug()`).

### ðŸ”¥ **Key Takeaways**
1. **Upcasting**
   - Converts child to parent reference.
   - Implicit and safe.
   - Enables polymorphism.
2. **Downcasting**
   - Converts parent to child reference.
   - Explicit and requires caution.
   - May cause `ClassCastException` if not done properly.
3. **Best Practices**
   - Always use `instanceof` to check if the reference is of the child class before downcasting.
   - Use upcasting for polymorphism and downcasting only when necessary.
