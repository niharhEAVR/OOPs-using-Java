In your Java code:

```java
byte b = 127;
int a = 1209;
b = (byte)a; // typecasting
```

You're typecasting an `int` value (`1209`) into a `byte`. Let's understand **why this gives `-71`** in detail.

### ðŸ”¹ Step-by-step Explanation

#### âœ… Step 1: Data Type Ranges

* `int`: 32 bits, range: **-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647**
* `byte`: 8 bits, range: **-128 to 127**

#### âœ… Step 2: Casting `int` to `byte`

When you cast an `int` (like 1209) to a `byte`, only the **lowest 8 bits** of the integer are kept.

So:

```
int a = 1209;
Binary of 1209 in 32 bits = 00000000 00000000 00000100 10111001
```

Now only the **last 8 bits** (`10111001`) are kept during casting.

```
These 8 bits: 10111001
```

#### âœ… Step 3: Interpreting `10111001` as a signed `byte`

`10111001` is a **negative number** in two's complement format because the **leftmost bit is 1** (sign bit).

To find out what number it is:

1. Invert the bits: `01000110`
2. Add 1: `01000111`
3. That equals: **71** in decimal
4. So, the original number was: **-71**

âœ… Final value stored in `b` is: `-71`

### ðŸ”¹ The second part:

```java
byte c = 10;
byte d = 30;
int result = c * d;
System.out.println(result); // 10 * 30 = 300
```

No issue here. Result is simply:

```
10 * 30 = 300 (stored as int)
```

### âœ… Final Output of the Code:

```
-71
300
```
