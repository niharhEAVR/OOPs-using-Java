### ‚úÖ **Threads in Java ‚Äì A Detailed Explanation**

---

### üî• **What is a Thread?**

A **thread** is the smallest unit of a program that can execute independently. In **Java**, a thread is a **lightweight process** that runs concurrently with other threads. It is used to perform **multitasking** within a single program, allowing multiple operations to run simultaneously.

In simple terms:
- A **program** is a collection of instructions.
- A **process** is a running instance of a program.
- A **thread** is a smaller, independent sequence of execution within a process.

For example:
Imagine a **music player**. While playing a song, it:
- Displays the lyrics (one thread)
- Plays the music (another thread)
- Allows you to click on buttons (yet another thread)

All these tasks run concurrently but independently.

---

‚úÖ **Exactly!** In **Java**, threads enable **true parallel execution**. When you create multiple threads, they can run **simultaneously** on different CPU cores (if available), allowing multiple tasks to be executed at the same time. 

---

### üî• **How Parallel Execution Works with Threads**
When you create multiple threads:
- Each thread has its **own execution path**.
- On a **multi-core CPU**, threads can run on **separate cores** simultaneously, achieving true parallelism.
- On a **single-core CPU**, threads are still concurrent but the OS uses **context switching** to simulate parallel execution.

---

### üöÄ **Example of Parallel Execution**
Imagine you are:
- **Downloading a file**
- **Playing a game**
- **Listening to music**

In **Java**, each of these tasks can run in a separate thread, enabling **true parallel execution**. The program won‚Äôt wait for the file to finish downloading before it lets you play the game or listen to music.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Simple Java Example to Demonstrate Parallelism**
```java
class Task1 extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Task 1 - Count: " + i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(500);  // Simulating some work
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

class Task2 extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Task 2 - Count: " + i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(500);  
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

public class ParallelExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Task1 t1 = new Task1();
        Task2 t2 = new Task2();
        
        t1.start();   // Start Task1 in a new thread
        t2.start();   // Start Task2 in a separate thread
    }
}
```

‚úÖ **Explanation:**
- **`Task1` and `Task2`** run in separate threads.
- Both tasks print numbers concurrently.
- The output order **varies** because both threads run **in parallel**, so their execution is interleaved.

---

### üî• **Output Example (varies every time):**
```
Task 1 - Count: 1  
Task 2 - Count: 1  
Task 1 - Count: 2  
Task 2 - Count: 2  
Task 1 - Count: 3  
Task 2 - Count: 3  
Task 1 - Count: 4  
Task 2 - Count: 4  
Task 1 - Count: 5  
Task 2 - Count: 5  
```

You can see that both threads run **simultaneously**, printing their values in an interleaved manner, demonstrating **parallel execution**. üöÄ

### üí° **Why Use Threads?**
1. **Concurrency:** Allows multiple parts of a program to execute simultaneously, making it more efficient.
2. **Parallelism:** On multi-core CPUs, multiple threads can run in true parallel.
3. **Improved Performance:** Time-consuming operations like file downloading, computation, or database querying can be run in separate threads, preventing the main program from freezing.
4. **Efficient Resource Utilization:** Threads share the same memory space, making them more efficient than creating multiple processes.

---

### üîé **Types of Threads in Java**

1. **User Threads:** 
   - Created by the **programmer** to perform specific tasks.
   - The **main thread** of any Java program is a user thread.
   - Program continues running until all user threads finish execution.

2. **Daemon Threads:** 
   - Low-priority threads that run in the background.
   - Used for **garbage collection**, handling background services, etc.
   - The program terminates as soon as all user threads finish, even if daemon threads are still running.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Java Thread Model**

In Java, the `java.lang.Thread` class and the `java.lang.Runnable` interface are used to create and manage threads.

The Java thread lifecycle consists of the following states:

1. **New:** 
   - A thread is created but not started.
   - `Thread t = new Thread();`

2. **Runnable:** 
   - The thread is ready to run but may wait for the CPU to schedule it.
   - `t.start();`

3. **Running:** 
   - The thread is executing its task.

4. **Blocked:** 
   - The thread is waiting for a **lock** to be released.

5. **Waiting:** 
   - The thread is waiting indefinitely for another thread to signal it.

6. **Timed Waiting:** 
   - The thread is waiting for a **specific period** of time.

7. **Terminated:** 
   - The thread has completed execution or was stopped.

### üõ†Ô∏è **How to Create Threads in Java**

There are two ways to create a thread in Java:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Extending the `Thread` class**
You can create a new class by extending the `Thread` class and overriding its `run()` method.

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        t1.start();  // Start the thread
    }
}
```
‚úÖ **Explanation:**
- `MyThread` is a custom class that extends `Thread`.
- The `run()` method contains the code to be executed by the thread.
- `start()` invokes the `run()` method in a **new thread**.

---

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Implementing the `Runnable` interface**
The `Runnable` interface allows you to create a thread by passing an object to the `Thread` constructor.

```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running using Runnable interface...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyRunnable r = new MyRunnable();
        Thread t1 = new Thread(r);   // Create thread using Runnable
        t1.start();
    }
}
```
‚úÖ **Explanation:**
- `MyRunnable` implements `Runnable`.
- `run()` contains the code that executes in the thread.
- The `Thread` constructor takes the `Runnable` object as an argument.
- `start()` initiates the thread.

### üö¶ **Difference Between `Thread` and `Runnable`:**

| **Aspect**         | **Thread Class**                         | **Runnable Interface**                      |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Inheritance        | Extends the `Thread` class directly.    | Implements the `Runnable` interface.      |
| Flexibility        | Cannot extend another class.             | Can extend another class.                  |
| Memory Efficiency  | Less memory-efficient.                   | More memory-efficient.                     |
| Use Case           | When extending behavior.                 | When implementing functionality.           |

### üî• **Thread Methods in Java**

| **Method**        | **Description**                                   |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `start()`         | Starts the execution of the thread.               |
| `run()`           | Contains the code executed by the thread.         |
| `sleep(ms)`       | Pauses the thread execution for `ms` milliseconds.|
| `join()`          | Waits for a thread to finish execution.           |
| `isAlive()`       | Returns `true` if the thread is still running.    |
| `yield()`         | Pauses the current thread temporarily.            |
| `setPriority()`   | Sets thread priority (`1` to `10`).               |
| `getName()`       | Returns the name of the thread.                   |

### üö¶ **Thread Synchronization**
In **multi-threading**, multiple threads may access shared resources, leading to data inconsistency. **Synchronization** ensures that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time.

‚úÖ **Example with Synchronized Block:**
```java
class Counter {
    int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;   // Only one thread can increment at a time
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Counter counter = new Counter();

        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        t1.join();
        t2.join();

        System.out.println("Count: " + counter.count);
    }
}
```
‚úÖ **Explanation:**
- The `synchronized` keyword ensures that only one thread at a time modifies the `count` variable.
- Both threads increment the value, but synchronization prevents race conditions.

---

### üöÄ **Advantages of Threads**
- Efficient use of CPU.
- Faster execution due to parallelism.
- Better responsiveness in GUI applications.
- Simplifies complex tasks by breaking them into multiple threads.

---

### ‚ùóÔ∏è **Disadvantages of Threads**
- **Complex Debugging:** Multi-threaded programs are harder to debug.
- **Race Conditions:** Multiple threads accessing shared data can lead to inconsistencies.
- **Deadlocks:** Two or more threads waiting for each other to release resources can result in a deadlock.

---

### ‚úÖ **Key Takeaway**
- Threads in Java enable concurrent execution.
- They can be created using `Thread` or `Runnable`.
- Synchronization is necessary to prevent data inconsistency in multi-threaded environments.
- Proper thread management enhances the efficiency and performance of Java applications. üöÄ
