Great question! Let's break this down line by line to understand **how this code works**, especially how a **non-static method (`mean()`) is being called from a static context (`main`)**, without causing an error.

---

## 💡 The Key Concepts

### 1. The `main()` method is `static`:
```java
public static void main(String[] args)
```
- It belongs to the **class**, not to any object.
- So it **cannot directly call non-static methods** (which need an object).

---

## 🧠 The Code:
```java
public class Static5 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        greet(); // ✅ Static method can be called from static main()
    }

    static void greet() {
        System.out.println("Hello!!");

        Static5 obj = new Static5(); // ✅ Create an object of the class
        obj.mean();                  // ✅ Use object to call non-static method
    }

    void mean() {
        System.out.println("me@n2");
    }
}
```

---

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Execution:

1. **Program starts at `main()`**:
   - `greet()` is static → so it can be called **directly** from `main()` (which is also static).

2. Inside `greet()`:
   - Prints: `"Hello!!"`
   - Then: `Static5 obj = new Static5();`
     - ✅ Creates an object of class `Static5`.
   - `obj.mean();`
     - ✅ Now it can call the **non-static method** `mean()` using that object.

3. Inside `mean()`:
   - Prints: `"me@n2"`

---

## ✅ Output:
```
Hello!!
me@n2
```

---

## 📌 So Why Does This Work?

- You **can’t call `mean()` directly** from `greet()` because it’s non-static.
- But once you create an object (`Static5 obj = new Static5();`), you can use that object to call any **non-static method**.

> 🧠 In simple terms:  
> Static methods = class-level  
> Non-static methods = object-level  
> To access object-level stuff from class-level, you need an object.

---

## 🔁 In contrast, this would cause an error:

```java
static void greet() {
    mean(); // ❌ ERROR: Cannot call non-static method without object
}
```

Because `mean()` is not static.
