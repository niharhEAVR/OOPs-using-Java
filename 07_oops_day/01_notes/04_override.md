Great question! Let's break it down clearly:

---

### üîç What's happening in this code?

```java
class Show {
}

public class Override3 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Show s = new Show();
        System.out.println(s);
    }
}
```

#### ‚úÖ Output (something like):
```
Show@6d06d69c
```

That output is Java's **default behavior** when printing an object. Here's what's happening in the background:

---

### üîß Under the hood:

When you write:

```java
System.out.println(s);
```

Java internally calls:

```java
System.out.println(s.toString());
```

And since you didn‚Äôt override `toString()`, it uses the **default implementation** from the `Object` class:

```java
public String toString() {
    return getClass().getName() + "@" + Integer.toHexString(hashCode());
}
```

Which results in:  
`ClassName@HashCodeInHex`

---

### üí° How to override `toString()` and provide a custom string:

Simply define the `toString()` method in your `Show` class like this:

```java
class Show {
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "This is my custom Show object!";
    }
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ Final Code:
```java
class Show {
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "This is my custom Show object!";
    }
}

public class Override3 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Show s = new Show();
        System.out.println(s);  // Calls your custom toString()
    }
}
```

### üñ® Output:
```
This is my custom Show object!
```

Great question! Here's the **short and clear answer**:

---

### ‚ùå **No, you cannot override a static method in Java.**

Static methods **belong to the class**, not to the objects. So they **don‚Äôt participate in runtime polymorphism**, which is the foundation of method overriding.

---

### üí° What actually happens?

If you define a static method with the same name in a subclass, you're not **overriding**, you're **hiding** the parent method. This is called **method hiding**, not overriding.

---

### üß™ Example:

```java
class Parent {
    static void show() {
        System.out.println("Static method in Parent");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    static void show() {
        System.out.println("Static method in Child");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent p = new Child();
        p.show();  // Output: Static method in Parent
    }
}
```

üß† Even though `p` is pointing to a `Child` object, it calls the `Parent`'s `show()` method.  
Why? Because **static methods are resolved at compile-time**, not runtime.

---

### ‚úÖ Summary:

| Feature                 | Can Override? | Resolved At   |
|-------------------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Instance Method**     | ‚úÖ Yes        | Runtime        |
| **Static Method**       | ‚ùå No (Hidden)| Compile-time   |
