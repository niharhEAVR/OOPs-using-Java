Awesome — now let’s talk about **Abstraction** in Java, another key pillar of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)!

---

### 🧠 **What is Abstraction in Java?**

**Abstraction** means **hiding the internal implementation details** and showing only the **essential features** to the user.

---

### 🔍 Simple Definition:
> **Abstraction = What to do, not how to do it.**

You define *what* a class or object can do, but you don’t reveal *how* it does it.

---

### 🧾 Real-Life Analogy:
Think of **driving a car**:
- You press the accelerator to increase speed 🚗💨
- You don’t need to know **how the engine works internally**

That’s abstraction — you interact with simple controls, not complex inner workings.

---

### 🔧 How to achieve Abstraction in Java?

Java provides **two main ways**:

1. **Abstract classes** (`abstract` keyword)
2. **Interfaces**

---

### 🔹 1. Using **Abstract Classes**

An **abstract class**:
- Can have both **abstract methods** (no body) and **concrete methods**
- Cannot be instantiated

```java
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void sound(); // abstract method

    void sleep() {         // concrete method
        System.out.println("Sleeping...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

---

### 🔹 2. Using **Interfaces**

An **interface**:
- Is fully abstract (until Java 7) — only method declarations
- From Java 8 onwards, it can have default and static methods too

```java
interface Vehicle {
    void start();
}

class Car implements Vehicle {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Car is starting...");
    }
}
```

### ✅ Why Use Abstraction?

- 🚫 Hide unnecessary details from the user
- ✅ Focus on *what* an object should do
- ♻️ Supports reusability and flexibility
- 🧪 Helps achieve **loose coupling**

---

### 🧩 Summary:

| Feature       | Abstract Class                    | Interface                          |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Can have constructors | ✅ Yes                     | ❌ No                               |
| Method types   | Abstract + Concrete              | Only Abstract (till Java 7)        |
| Multiple inheritance | ❌ Not allowed             | ✅ Allowed via interfaces           |

Want to see a project-style example (like ATM, Animal, or Shape app) using abstraction? I can create one for practice!


Perfect! Let’s build a **simple abstraction-based project** using the **Shape** example. It’s a classic and very easy to understand.

---

## 🟩 Project: **Shape Area Calculator** using Abstraction

We'll create an **abstract class** called `Shape`, and multiple shapes like `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Triangle` will **inherit and implement** the area logic differently.

---

### 🧱 Step 1: Abstract Class

```java
abstract class Shape {
    // Abstract method - no body
    abstract double area();

    // Concrete method
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Calculating area of shape...");
    }
}
```

---

### 🔵 Step 2: Subclasses that implement the abstract method

```java
class Circle extends Shape {
    double radius;

    Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    @Override
    double area() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
    double length, width;

    Rectangle(double length, double width) {
        this.length = length;
        this.width = width;
    }

    @Override
    double area() {
        return length * width;
    }
}

class Triangle extends Shape {
    double base, height;

    Triangle(double base, double height) {
        this.base = base;
        this.height = height;
    }

    @Override
    double area() {
        return 0.5 * base * height;
    }
}
```

---

### 🟨 Step 3: Main class to use abstraction

```java
public class ShapeApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape s1 = new Circle(5);
        Shape s2 = new Rectangle(4, 6);
        Shape s3 = new Triangle(3, 7);

        s1.display();
        System.out.println("Circle area: " + s1.area());

        s2.display();
        System.out.println("Rectangle area: " + s2.area());

        s3.display();
        System.out.println("Triangle area: " + s3.area());
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ Output:
```
Calculating area of shape...
Circle area: 78.53981633974483
Calculating area of shape...
Rectangle area: 24.0
Calculating area of shape...
Triangle area: 10.5
```

---

### 🔁 Why this shows **abstraction**:
- You never directly access the implementation of `area()`.
- Each shape decides its own logic (but the user just calls `.area()`).

That’s a *really smart* observation — it **does look like a normal class**, right? Let’s fix that confusion by giving you a **real-world analogy** where abstraction makes more sense **in practice**, not just in code.

---

## 🏧 Real-World Example: **ATM Machine**

### 🔐 Abstraction in Action:

Imagine you’re using an **ATM**. You:
- Insert your card 💳
- Enter your PIN 🔢
- Select “Withdraw Cash”
- Take the money 💸

Now, **do you know** how the ATM:
- Talks to the bank’s server?
- Verifies your PIN securely?
- Updates your account balance?

Nope. You **only know what it does**, not **how it does it**.  
That’s abstraction.

---

### 👨‍💻 Java Example Based on This:

```java
abstract class ATM {
    // Abstract methods - What to do
    abstract void insertCard();
    abstract void enterPin();
    abstract void withdrawCash();

    // Concrete method - common functionality
    void ejectCard() {
        System.out.println("Card ejected.");
    }
}
```

---

### 🏦 SBI ATM — specific implementation

```java
class SBIATM extends ATM {
    @Override
    void insertCard() {
        System.out.println("SBI ATM: Card inserted.");
    }

    @Override
    void enterPin() {
        System.out.println("SBI ATM: PIN entered.");
    }

    @Override
    void withdrawCash() {
        System.out.println("SBI ATM: ₹1000 withdrawn.");
    }
}
```

---

### 🏃‍♂️ Main class

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ATM myATM = new SBIATM();  // abstraction: using ATM type
        myATM.insertCard();
        myATM.enterPin();
        myATM.withdrawCash();
        myATM.ejectCard();
    }
}
```

---

### 🧠 What's abstract here?

You use the ATM (via `ATM` class), but you don’t know **how it works inside (bank communication, encryption, etc.)**. You’re just given an interface.

That’s the **exact purpose of abstraction** — **focus on what**, not **how**.
